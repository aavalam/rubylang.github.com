## RubyLang.info

RubyLang.info is a community driven web site, dedicated to helping both new and experienced Ruby 
developers. We are hosted on Github, where anyone can contribute to the site without going 
through unnecessary barriers. We strive to be the best possible resource for the 
Ruby programming language.

### Getting Started

  The setup is very easy. All is required in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to start contributing.

  1) Install Jekyll by running
  
      gem install jekyll
    
  2) Run Jekyll in the source code directory. This will generate the necessary static files, just 
  navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the site.
  
      jekyll --server

  Note: For styling, we are currently using [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) but looking to migrate over
  to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in the near future. Both are very similar and if you're familiar with any, 
  you'll have an easy time changing the stylesheets. Stylus can be install using node + npm. More documentation on
  this is coming soon.
  
  3) Once you've made changes and you're satisfied, just push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request.
